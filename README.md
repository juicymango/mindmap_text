# Mind Map Text

Mind Map Text is a web-based mind mapping application that uses a column-based interface similar to macOS Finder to visualize and interact with hierarchical data. It's designed for users who prefer a text-based and keyboard-driven approach to mind mapping.

## Features

*   **Column-Based UI:** Navigate your mind map in a familiar, intuitive column view with auxiliary root column.
*   **Adjustable Column Height:** Columns now support vertical scrolling when containing many nodes, with a maximum height constraint and custom scrollbar styling.
*   **Node Operations:** Easily add, delete, and edit nodes using toolbar controls.
*   **File Operations:** Save your mind maps as JSON or a simple, human-readable text format.
*   **Copy and Paste:** Copy and paste nodes in JSON or text format using toolbar buttons.
*   **Node Movement:** Move nodes up and down within their parent's children list.
*   **State Management:** Uses Zustand for efficient and predictable state management.
*   **File Path Memory:** Remembers your last used file paths for quick saving and loading.
*   **Enhanced Visual Design:** Modern styling with improved spacing, shadows, and color-coded node states.
*   **Status Bar:** Real-time display of save status, file information, and node count statistics.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** 122 tests across 11 test files ensuring robust functionality and preventing regressions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v14 or later)
*   npm

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/juicymango/mindmap_text.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd mindmap_text
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. The test suite includes 122 tests covering all components, utilities, and edge cases, including comprehensive tests for the column height improvements and scrolling behavior.

## Usage

*   **Select a node:** Click on a node to select it. The children of the selected node will be displayed in the next column.
*   **Add a child node:** Select a node and click the "Add Child" button in the toolbar to add a child to it.
*   **Delete a node:** Select a node and click the "Delete" button in the toolbar to delete it and all its children.
*   **Edit a node:** Double-click on a node's text to edit it.
*   **Move nodes:** Select a node and use "Move Up" or "Move Down" buttons to reorder it within its parent.
*   **Copy and Paste:** Select a node and use "Copy JSON"/"Copy Text" to copy to clipboard, then "Paste JSON"/"Paste Text" to paste as a child of another selected node.

## UI Improvements

The application has been enhanced with several visual and functional improvements:

### Column Height Enhancements (Task 52)
- **Adjustable Height:** Columns now have a maximum height constraint of `calc(100vh - 120px)` to account for toolbar and status bar
- **Vertical Scrolling:** When a column contains many nodes, it automatically becomes scrollable with a custom-styled scrollbar
- **Fixed Width:** Columns maintain a consistent 240px width while allowing flexible height
- **Top Alignment:** Columns with different heights align to the top for better visual consistency

### Visual Design
- **Color-Coded Nodes:** Four distinct node types with appropriate colors (selected, on path, with children, without children)
- **Enhanced Styling:** Modern button design, improved spacing, and subtle shadows
- **Status Bar:** Real-time display of save status, current file path, format information, and node count
- **Root Column Highlighting:** The root column is visually distinguished with a blue left border

### Responsive Behavior
- **Horizontal Scrolling:** Smooth horizontal scrolling for deep mind map structures
- **Custom Scrollbars:** Both horizontal and vertical scrollbars are styled for consistency
- **Flexible Layout:** The interface adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining usability

## File Formats

### JSON

The mind map can be saved in a JSON format that represents the hierarchical structure of the nodes.

```json
{
  "root": {
    "text": "Root",
    "children": [
      {
        "text": "Child 1",
        "children": [],
        "selected_child_idx": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Text

The mind map can also be saved in a simple, human-readable text format that uses tabs to represent the hierarchy.

```
Root
	Child 1
	Child 2
		Grandchild 1
	Child 3
```
