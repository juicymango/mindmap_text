# Implementation and Testing Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing and testing the mind map application using React.

## Project Setup

1.  **Initialize React App:** Use `create-react-app` to set up a new React project.
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app mindmap-app
    ```
2.  **Dependencies:** Add any necessary dependencies, such as a state management library (e.g., Redux or Zustand) if needed.

## Component Structure

The application will be broken down into the following components:

-   **`App`:** The main component that holds the entire application.
-   **`MindMap`:** The main container for the mind map, which will manage the state of the mind map data.
-   **`Column`:** A component that renders a single column of nodes.
-   **`Node`:** A component that renders a single node within a column.
-   **`Toolbar`:** A component for buttons like "Save", "Load", etc.

## State Management

-   The mind map data will be stored in a central place, either using React's `useState` and `useContext` hooks for simpler cases, or a dedicated state management library like Redux or Zustand for more complex state logic.
-   The state will be a tree-like structure, as defined in `docs/ui_and_interaction_design.md`.

## Implementation Details

1.  **Column View:** The `MindMap` component will render a series of `Column` components based on the selected path.
2.  **Node Selection:** Each `Node` component will have an `onClick` handler that updates the selected node in the application state.
3.  **Expansion:** When a node is selected, the `MindMap` component will determine the children to be displayed in the next column and render a new `Column` component.
4.  **Drag and Drop:** The `react-beautiful-dnd` or a similar library will be used to implement the drag-and-drop functionality for manual sorting of nodes.
5.  **File Operations:** The browser's File System Access API will be used to save and load the mind map data as a JSON file.

## Testing Strategy

-   **Unit Tests:** Each component will be tested in isolation using `jest` and `react-testing-library`. Tests will cover rendering, user interactions, and state changes.
-   **Integration Tests:** The application will be tested as a whole to ensure that all components work together correctly. This will involve simulating user flows, such as creating a new mind map, adding nodes, and saving the mind map.
-   **End-to-End Tests:** A framework like Cypress could be used to automate browser testing and verify the application's functionality from a user's perspective.
