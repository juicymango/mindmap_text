# Test Documentation

This document provides comprehensive testing documentation for the mind map application, including test structure, testing approach, and test coverage.

## Test Overview

The application has comprehensive test coverage with 159 tests across 13 test files, covering unit tests, integration tests, and component tests using React Testing Library and Jest. The test suite covers all UI components including the enhanced Toolbar with styled-components fixes, MobileToolbar with menu positioning fixes, StatusBar, improved visual styling components, Task 52 column height improvements, and comprehensive Task 56 mobile functionality.

## Testing Philosophy

### React Testing Library Best Practices

The testing approach follows React Testing Library best practices:

- **Screen queries**: Use `screen.getBy*` and `screen.queryBy*` methods for querying elements
- **No node access rules**: Avoid direct DOM node access, use semantic queries instead
- **User-centric testing**: Test from the user's perspective rather than implementation details
- **Accessibility**: Test with accessible selectors when possible

### Test Utilities

The project includes comprehensive testing utilities in `src/utils/test-utils.ts`:

- **Type-safe mocking**: `createMockMindMapStore()` for type-safe Zustand store mocking
- **Type guards**: `isNonNullString()`, `isValidMindMap()` for runtime type checking
- **Test data builders**: `createTestMindMap()`, `createTestNode()` for consistent test data
- **Clipboard API mocking**: Mock utilities for testing copy/paste functionality
