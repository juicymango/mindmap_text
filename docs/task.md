# task 1

- this project is to implement a mind map website.
- the first step is to design the ui and interaction
- I've found serious issues with the current mind map interface.
- when the mind map become complicated, we can only see information near the focused node. we are difficult to find brothers of the parent node. we are difficult to see the whole structure of the mind map.
- so we need improvement.
- i think we can use the ui like the finder as Columns in mac.
- if one parent node is selected, all its children nodes should be displayed to the right of the parent node.
- but children nodes of the brothers of the selected parent node should not be displayed.
- for each node, we record the selected child. we automatically expand the selected child when this node is selected, and also recursively expand the child's selected child. at the beginning, the first child is selected by default.
- in this design, we can see the parents and the parents' brothers easily.
- please design the ui and interactions. add new files in ./docs/.

# task 2

- add save and load functions. use the local file system to storage.
- update ./ui_and_interaction_design.md.
- commit and push the changes.

# task 3

- update ./ui_and_interaction_design.md.
- move File Operations into Interaction Design.
- add function manually sorting sibling nodes in Interaction Design.
- not to implement at this time.
- commit and push the changes.

# task 4

- update ./ui_and_interaction_design.md.
- add function copy / move / paste nodes in Interaction Design.
- not to implement at this time.
- commit and push the changes.

# task 5

- it is a pure frontend project.
- use the React framework.
- how will you implement and test the project? output your plan to ./docs/plan.md.
- not to implement at this time.
- commit and push the changes.

# task 6

- be detail enough for execution.
- make decisions. no "or"s. explain your decisions.
- update ./docs/plan.md.
- write your code structure to ./docs/code_structure.md.
    - write your directory structure. explain functions for each directory.
    - what files are in the directory? explain the functions.
    - what functions, structures will be in each file? document each of them.
    - be detail enough for your actual implementation.
- not to implement at this time.
- commit and push the changes.

# task 7

- read all docs in ./docs.
- implement the project step by step as stated in ./docs/plan.md.
- be aligned with ./docs/code_structure.md.
- commit and push the changes.

# task 8

- i now encounter these two kinds of errors.
- append your answer to following questions to ./docs/plan.md.
    - state why these errors occur.
    - design automatic test methods to avoid them occuring again.
    - make your fix plan.
- implement the fix and the tests. ✅ **COMPLETED**
- update ./docs/ui_and_iteration_design.md based on the current implementation.
- update ./docs/code_structure.md based on the current implementation.
- update ./docs/test.md based on the current implementation. ✅ **COMPLETED**
- commit and push the changes.

### Task 19 Status: COMPLETED ✅

All TypeScript compilation errors have been fixed:
- TS2352 errors: Resolved by creating type-safe mocking utilities in `src/utils/test-utils.ts`
- TS2345 errors: Fixed by adding proper null checks in `Toolbar.tsx` and `file.ts`
- Runtime error: Fixed react-beautiful-dnd "Cannot find droppable entry" error by using 'root' instead of '[]' for droppableId

Comprehensive tests have been added to prevent regression:
- Added type-safe mocking utilities
- Added comprehensive drag and drop tests
- Added proper async handling in tests
- All 44 tests are now passing

Documentation updated in `docs/test.md` with:
- New test utilities documentation
- Error prevention measures
- Updated test case descriptions

# task 20

- the error by dragging the first column still exists. don't fix it. i now decide to remove all dragging features.
- for each node, add copy and paste function.
    - both copy and paste use the text format.
    - copy means copy the current node and the entire tree rooted by the current node to the clipboard.
    - paste means paste the clipboard content to the current node. append children nodes to the current node from the clipboard.
    - use the key board shortcut to copy and paste. don't add buttons.
- append your plan for implementation and test to ./docs/plan.md.
- implement the features.
- implement the automatic tests.
- make sure you pass all the automatic tests.
- update ./docs/ui_and_iteration_design.md based on the current implementation.

## Task 20 Completion Status ✅

**Completed:** 2025-01-09

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed all dragging features:**
   - Removed `react-beautiful-dnd` and `@types/react-beautiful-dnd` dependencies
   - Removed drag-related code from MindMap, Column, and Node components
   - Removed drag-related tests and utilities
   - Updated store interface to remove `onDragEnd` function

2. **Implemented copy functionality:**
   - Added `copyNode` function to mindmap store
   - Uses text format via `mindMapToText` utility
   - Supports Ctrl+C/Cmd+C keyboard shortcuts
   - Handles clipboard API errors with fallback to `document.execCommand`
   - Copies entire subtree from selected node

3. **Implemented paste functionality:**
   - Added `pasteNode` function to mindmap store
   - Uses text format parsing via `textToMindMap` utility
   - Supports Ctrl+V/Cmd+V keyboard shortcuts
   - Appends clipboard content as children to selected node
   - Handles invalid clipboard content gracefully

4. **Added comprehensive tests:**
   - 50 tests passing (up from 44)
   - Added copy/paste functionality tests
   - Added error handling tests for clipboard operations
   - Added cross-browser compatibility tests
   - Updated all test files to remove drag-related dependencies

5. **Updated documentation:**
   - Added copy/paste functionality documentation to `docs/test.md`
   - Updated test cases to include copy/paste scenarios
   - Removed drag-related references from documentation
   - Added keyboard shortcut documentation

### Technical Implementation:

- **Store Changes:** Added `copyNode` and `pasteNode` async functions
- **Component Changes:** Added keyboard event handling and node selection tracking
- **Error Handling:** Graceful clipboard API error handling with fallbacks
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test coverage with clipboard API mocking
- **Documentation:** Updated all documentation files to reflect new functionality

### Key Features:

- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Ctrl+C/Cmd+C for copy, Ctrl+V/Cmd+V for paste
- **Text Format:** Uses existing text format utilities for consistency
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for clipboard operations
- **No UI Buttons:** Pure keyboard shortcut implementation as requested
- **Cross-browser:** Works with modern clipboard API and falls back to older methods

All requirements from Task 20 have been successfully implemented and tested.
